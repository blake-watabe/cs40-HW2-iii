# cs40-HW2
2nd assignment for CS40 (Machine Structures and Assembly. The assigned was to modify an interface for a 1D array
to accomodate a 2D design called UArray2. From there, we created 2 programs: Sudoku.c which reads in a pnm image and uses the UArray2
interface to determine whether the image is a valid sudoku solution, and Unblackedges.c, which takes in a pbm image and removes
black edge pixels (such as borders).
